Welcome to *Blue Sky*, an immersive web experience. This project blends interactive design with a narrative about healing, memory, and the fragile connections that might save us.



## About the Story
This is a story about the weight of the past, the fragility of the human heart, and the desperate search for a reason to keep looking up at the sky. It explores the fine line between despair and hope, reality and illusion, and the quiet moments that can change everything.

**Key figures in his world:**
- **Lisa** - his nurse, an anchor in the chaos
- **Emily** - the girl on the rooftop, his blue sky (real or imagined?)  
- **Mir** - fellow patient, silent understanding
- **"Silvy"** - imagined confidante, keeper of his deepest thoughts

**Built with Three.js cloud formations that shift from pink to blue to gray, mirroring the protagonist's internal weather.**
